# NYC-TAXI-TRIP-TIME-PREDICTION

The NYC Taxi Trip Time Prediction project is a machine learning regression model that aims to predict the duration of a taxi trip in New York City based on various input features. The goal of the project is to improve the efficiency and convenience of taxi services by providing more accurate estimates of trip duration for both passengers and drivers.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes historical data on taxi trips in NYC, including information on pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and trip distances. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical variables into numerical values. Feature engineering techniques are applied to extract additional information from the data, such as the day of the week, time of day, and distances between locations.

The model is trained using a variety of regression algorithms, including linear regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance. Model evaluation is conducted using metrics such as mean absolute error and R-squared. The final model chosen is the LightGBM Regression model, which demonstrates the best performance among the models considered.

The trained model is tested using a hold-out test set and achieves high accuracy in predicting the duration of taxi trips, with an average error of less than 10 minutes.

## Important Features

The project explores the important features that influence the duration of a taxi trip. The results indicate that pickup and dropoff locations, time of day, and trip distance are the most significant factors in determining the duration of a taxi trip.

## Potential Improvements

In future iterations, the model can be enhanced by incorporating additional data sources such as weather data, traffic data, and other transportation-related data. This would enable the model to account for real-time conditions that impact trip duration. Furthermore, integrating the model with a real-time mapping and routing service would provide users with up-to-date estimates of trip duration based on current traffic conditions.

## Benefits and Applications

The NYC Taxi Trip Time Prediction project successfully develops a machine learning regression model capable of predicting the duration of taxi trips in New York City with a high level of accuracy. The model has several potential applications, including:

- **Improved Taxi Services**: Taxi companies can utilize the model to enhance the efficiency and convenience of their services by providing more accurate estimates of trip duration for both passengers and drivers. This helps in planning and optimizing routes, reducing waiting times, and increasing customer satisfaction.

- **Informed Decision Making**: Passengers can leverage the model's predictions to plan their trips more effectively, manage their time, and make informed decisions about transportation options.

- **Transportation System Optimization**: By analyzing the important features influencing trip duration, transportation authorities can gain insights into factors that impact traffic congestion and identify areas for improvement in the transportation infrastructure.

## Future Development

The project's future development could involve refining the model's accuracy and exploring advanced techniques in feature engineering and model selection. Additionally, incorporating real-time data and integrating the model into a user-friendly application or API would enable seamless access to accurate trip duration predictions.
